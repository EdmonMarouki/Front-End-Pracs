Hi there, 

In this repo you will find all of the projects that I did while learning Web Development.
Most of the projects are from The Odin Project course. 

In this repo these languages where used: 

    •	HTML
    •	CSS
    •	JavaScript
    •	Python(Near future)

And these Framworks:

    •	jQuery
    •	AngualrJS
    •	ReactJS
    •	Bootstrap
    •	Tailwind CSS

These project can be copied and used without me knowledge. These project are good to follow should you want to use them as you're learning Web Development. 

Thanks for stopping by!
